- 👋 Hi, I’m @augustus-thomas, currently attending the College of Wooster. I am a declared BA in Physics, but am looking to break into Computer Science and Mathematics.
- 👀 I’m also interested in philosophy and poltical philosophy. I read alot of science fiction in my off time. 
- 🌱 I’m currently using Jekyll to build a personal blog and teaching myself CLI utilities in the process. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source information and data science projects. Long term I would like to achieve an MS in Electrical Engineering and get into embedded systems architecture. Short term I would like to get involved in chemical physics research (particularly Dr. Niklas Manz' B-Z reaction studies) which in my view implicate a new paradigm for computing.
