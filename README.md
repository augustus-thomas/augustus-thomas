- I’m @augustus-thomas, currently attending the College of Wooster. I am a declared BA in Physics and Computer Science double major.
- I am working in [The College of Wooster Wavelab](https://wavelab.spaces.wooster.edu/) on an [Electron Drift Veloctiy Analogue](https://wavelab.spaces.wooster.edu/electron-drift-velocity-analogue/). When we get good results it woud be fun to publish in AIP's Physics of Fluids!
- I’m also interested in philosophy. I am generally interested in the applications of Physics and Computers for the betterment of society, and the analysis of cybernetic systems as fundamentally social.
- I’m currently playing around with ArchLinux config files - hopefully accidentally learning about Linux and its CLI and scripting in the process. I'm (exclusively) running an i3 EndeavorOS setup on an old MacBook. Did you know I cant boot MacOS on my machine anymore because Apple Mac (TM) doesnt let you dual boot on its machines? Do I even own this machine if I cant boot whatever software I want on it???? *sigh*
- Im looking to collaborate on open source information and data science projects. Aaron Swartz and Snowden and everyone else were right. Even the hacktivists. So too was [Robert Ochigame](https://logicmag.io/care/informatics-of-the-oppressed/). 
- Long term I would like to achieve an MS in Electrical Engineering and get into embedded systems architecture. Building non-standard computaional machines for non-standard people might be my life's work (we'll see)
