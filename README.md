# I'm Augustus or Gus
## Who am I?
- I’m a current undergrad at the College of Wooster. I am a double major in Physics and CS.
- I am currently working on a submission to the [Mining Software Repositories 2025](https://2025.msrconf.org/track/msr-2025-mining-challenge) conference. I am investigating factors that prevent developers from updating their dependencies to newer versions. 
- I am currently working on a capstone project for the [COSI](https://cosi.ssl.berkeley.edu/) python library [cosipy](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/develop/cosipy). I am profiling their implementation of the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm. I hope to help make the library faster and more accessible to astrophysicists. I am not officially affiliated with the project. 
- I have worked on the [ADAPT mission](https://adapt.physics.wustl.edu/) as an NSF-REU. I tested some dynamically slimmable linear regression neural networks for gamma ray localization on a high-energy Compton space telescope. The goal was to do floating point prediction under size, power, and time constraints. Imagine a linear NN with an arbitrary "selection window" of active nodes, with control in the x and y "directions" of the network. It failed. 
- I have worked in [The College of Wooster Wavelab](https://wavelab.spaces.wooster.edu/) on an [Electron Drift Velocitiy Analogue](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.29465.84323) funded by an NSF-REU grant. I presented a poster at APS March 2024, and I have plans to submit to AIP's Physics of Fluids journal sometime before graduating.
## What do I think?
- I'd like to collaborate on open source information and data science projects, particularly ones with a compelling social impact. I admire Cory Doctorow's work, and his profound belief that [the internet is getting worse](https://www.wired.com/story/big-tech-wont-let-you-leave-heres-a-way-out/). 
- Swartz, Snowden, Manning and everyone else were right in their view that access to information is the key to a free society. So too was [Robert Ochigame](https://logicmag.io/care/informatics-of-the-oppressed/). I think programmers collectively wield the most powerful tool ever built, and we should be opinionated about what we do with it.
## Where am I headed?
- I would like to work on [software for embedded systems](https://sbs.wustl.edu/) architectures or scientific simulation work.
- I would like to build software that helps vulnerable people.
- I would like to achieve an MS in Electrical Engineering or go directly into industry out of undergrad.
