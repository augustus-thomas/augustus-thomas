# I'm Augustus or Gus
## Who am I?
- I’m @augustus-thomas, currently attending the College of Wooster. I am a BA in Physics and Computer Science double major. I've done research, I can write Physics simulations. 
- I have worked in [The College of Wooster Wavelab](https://wavelab.spaces.wooster.edu/) on an [Electron Drift Velocitiy Analogue](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.29465.84323) funded by an NSF-REU grant. I presented a poster at APS March 2024, and I have plans to submit to AIP's Physics of Fluids journal later in 2024.
- I'd like collaborate on open source information and data science projects, particularly ones with a compelling social impact. Swartz, Snowden, Manning and everyone else were right in their view that access to information is the key to a free society. So too was [Robert Ochigame](https://logicmag.io/care/informatics-of-the-oppressed/).
## Where am I headed?
- I would like to work on software for embedded systems architectures or scientific simulation work.
- I would like to build software that helps vulnerable people.
- I would like to achieve an MS in Electrical Engineering or go directly into industry out of undergrad.
